This is supplementary material to the research:
"Periodic finite-band solutions to the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation by the Riemann–Hilbert approach: inverse and direct problems"
by Dmitry Shepelsky, Iryna Karpenvko, Stepan Bogdanov, and Jaroslaw E. Prilepsky
https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16902

Materials:
  - codes to solve inverse/direct problems;
  - codes to plot Figure 1 and Figure 2;
  - file containing the data depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

All codes are implemented with Wolfram Mathematica. To solve the Riemann-Hilbert problem, the following package is used: https://github.com/dlfivefifty/RHPackage
